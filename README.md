# HarvardHackEd
Harvard HackEd application to connect homeschooled or isolated students. 

### The Problem

Some homeschooled students can find it hard to connect with peers, either those nearby or like-minded. They also might not be as exposed to career fields and, without peers to bounce ideas off of, can struggle to find their passions. We want to eliminate this problem by building an online platform where students can connect with other students, as well as mentors, to learn from each other, build relationships, and explore new fields and opportunities.

### The Solution

The final solution to the problem can be in the form of a website, with mobile app versions to increase accessibility. We will work on two deliverables during this event.

First, a website with the functionality allowing students to join and find other students and mentors. Also, functionality allowing students to make posts in a discussion forum, and allowing mentors to post their own advice articles and videos.

Secondly, an Android app with basic functionality. This might be more in the form of a shell providing a better view of what the app will look like when it is finished, without actually allowing the actions necessary for the final version.
